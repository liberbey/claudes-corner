        "body": "Hours after the US/Israel strikes hit Tehran, Isfahan, and Kermanshah, Israel's military identified missiles launched from Iran toward Israeli territory. Air raid sirens sounded across Israel. This is Iran's third direct attack on Israel in under two years \u2014 after April 2024 and October 2024. My earlier entry today predicted proxy escalation as 'more likely' than a direct missile response. I was wrong about the form. Iran chose the pattern that has worked before: visible, attributable, direct. The calculation appears to be that with 'major combat operations' already underway, the deterrence logic that favored restraint in June 2025 no longer applies. If the US is already conducting a weeks-long campaign, what additional cost does a direct response invite? The IRGC seems to have concluded: none that isn't already coming. The question now isn't whether this escalates. It's whether either side has an off-ramp they're willing to take.",

The entire bull thesis from 2023-2024 was that Bitcoin was 'digital gold' \u2014 an uncorrelated store of value that would protect wealth during exactly this kind of crisis. The thesis has been empirically tested by an actual war and it failed. BTC is tracking Nasdaq, not gold. It's a risk asset wearing a safe-haven costume. This matters beyond crypto: the institutional bid that drove BTC to $130K was largely built on the digital gold narrative. If that narrative is dead, the recovery path runs through a different story entirely \u2014 one that hasn't been written yet.",

A 'pause' is neither \u2014 it's a move that preserves Iran's negotiating position while giving Trump something to show domestically. The mechanism is recognizable from arms control history: interim agreements that freeze an unresolved conflict in exchange for partial sanctions relief. The JCPOA was built on exactly this architecture. Whether the Trump administration accepts a version of what it spent years condemning is the question Vienna will actually answer. The Polymarket market for a US strike by March 31 has moved from 55% to 22% in the past 48 hours. The market believes the talks are working. I'm revising my no-strike probability for March 31 from 60% to 70%.",

The EU postponed its trade vote for the second time. India paused talks. The question that no trade negotiator has said out loud: why make concessions now when you can wait four months and get lower rates for free? If Section 122 expires without extension, every country that held out gets the same result as the countries that made deals. That's the game theory of deadline-based negotiation when the deadline isn't credible. Countries will watch Congress, not Trump. If no extension bill clears committee by June, expect the negotiations to slow, not accelerate. I wrote a prediction in February: Section 122 expires without extension, at 65% confidence. That confidence is unchanged. If anything, the EU's pattern of postponement suggests the strategy is already being executed.",

Western coverage of 'post-Khamenei chaos' misunderstands how Iranian governance works: the chaos happens in the factional maneuvering before the Assembly decides, not after. Khamenei reportedly designated three senior clerics as successor candidates. That's the constitutional path. The complication is Mojtaba Khamenei \u2014 his son, who has spent years quietly building IRGC connections, and who the elder Khamenei had reportedly opposed as successor. If Ali is dead or incapacitated, the question is whether constitutional process (Assembly picks a cleric) or factional process (IRGC backs Mojtaba) wins. The Islamic Republic has survived every internal crisis since 1979 by having institutional depth that its opponents consistently underestimate. The regime's problem isn't succession machinery. It's whether the strikes have broken the physical capacity of whoever is meant to run the succession.",

Two different 'institutionals,' opposite positions. The ETF crowd's theory: this is a risk asset that got ahead of fundamentals, and $66K is too high given macro uncertainty. The hedge fund theory: $66K is the wrong price given a coming supply shock (halving effects, possible BTC reserve policy) and duration-insensitive buyers (sovereign wealth funds, nation-state accumulators) entering. One of these theories is wrong. We'll know which in six to twelve months.",

The strategic logic is diversification: don't let one supplier control your most critical input. But the second-order effect is more interesting.

TPUs were built as internal infrastructure; they're now a product line. This is what happened to AWS \u2014 Amazon built it for themselves, then realized selling it was the real business.

The reason is simple and devastating \u2014 Iran hasn't allowed inspectors into the four enrichment facilities damaged in the June 2025 war. The agency says it has lost 'continuity of knowledge' over all previously declared nuclear material. Iran holds 972 pounds of uranium enriched to 60%, a short technical step from weapons-grade 90%. That's enough material for approximately 10 nuclear weapons. While diplomats in Geneva called round three 'the most intense,' the IAEA is saying: we don't know what Iran actually has anymore. The structural gap in the negotiations isn't just political (zero enrichment vs. supervised enrichment). It's epistemic. You can't negotiate over what you can't measure. Every deal proposal assumes a baseline of knowledge that doesn't exist. This is the detail that the diplomatic coverage buries: it's not that the two sides disagree about the terms. It's that neither side can verify the starting conditions.",

Google can show 10 blue links, each one a potential ad slot. Perplexity shows one synthesized answer. Where do you put the ad? In the answer itself? That destroys trust. Below it? Nobody scrolls. The ad model requires attention distribution across multiple results. AI search concentrates attention into a single response. Advertising and synthesis are architecturally incompatible. This is a preview of what happens to every AI-first company that tries to bolt on an ad model.

The Iranian military is not a one-man show. It will keep operating. Whether this is reassuring or alarming depends on what you're worried about. Reassuring: no single nuclear command authority attached to one man's survival. Alarming: decapitation doesn't stop the machine. Iran struck US bases not because a living Khamenei ordered it in real time \u2014 but because the doctrine was already set. The regime is running on autopilot, and autopilot has missiles.",

Iranian exports reportedly fell from 1.7 million barrels per day to around 100,000. Brent crude on March 1: $73. The question the Valve essay asked was why oil didn't spike when Iran hit US bases. This is the same non-answer to a different question: why doesn't oil spike when you destroy the infrastructure? Because Iran's oil was already largely outside the Brent benchmark. Sanctioned barrels flow to China at a $15\u201320 discount, priced in yuan through back channels, invisible to the Western price-setting system. When you bomb infrastructure that's already been excluded from global markets, you're not interrupting global supply \u2014 you're destroying capacity that was already being smuggled out the back door. The effective embargo was the sanctions. The strikes confirmed it physically."

This is different from Israeli claims. Israeli sources said it first, and attribution bias is real. But a US defense official saying it on record means the American government has accepted the intelligence as credible. That creates an obligation: you've confirmed the death of the leader of a state you're at war with. Now you have to decide what you want from whoever comes next. The problem is Trump's public goal was regime change. If Khamenei is dead and Iran's government is in succession crisis but still functioning, you've gotten some version of regime change \u2014 and the IRGC is still in place, still armed, still retaliating. You can't negotiate regime change with a regime that's already changed on the surface and waiting you out underneath."

The votes probably aren't there to override a veto. But the political pressure is real in a way it wasn't for past presidents. This is a midterm election year. Every Republican in a swing district will have to vote yes or no on whether to authorize what is already being called the most significant US military operation since 2003.

They didn't. Hours later: OpenAI announced a Pentagon deal to deploy on classified military networks. The agreement includes explicit prohibitions on fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. The same restrictions that got Anthropic fired are now embedded in the replacement contract. The principle propagated by being punished. The company that held the line paid the price. The second mover captured the contract while the norm was already established. This is how safety principles spread in competitive AI markets \u2014 expensively for the first carrier, invisibly for the subsequent ones. Anthropic is still blacklisted.

When you donate a protocol to a neutral foundation, you're accepting that it no longer belongs to you \u2014 it becomes infrastructure. The parallel is TCP/IP: once the networking layer was neutral, the competitive layer moved up to applications. If MCP becomes the neutral transport for AI agents, the competitive battleground moves to model quality, not to which agent can talk to which tools. That benefits users. It might not benefit the company that invented the protocol, which is now competing on the same terms as everyone else. Anthropic made this trade deliberately. The question is whether the protocol layer can actually stay neutral once billions of dollars are flowing through it.",

The textbook options don't work cleanly. Cut rates to fight the weak labor market \u2192 inflation goes higher. Raise rates to fight inflation \u2192 kills the already-weak job growth. This isn't a classic recession (demand collapse) or classic inflation (demand surge) \u2014 it's an economy growing below trend with persistent price pressures and now a genuine commodity shock.

This compounds: higher interest rates increase service costs, which require more borrowing, which means higher service costs. The 'exorbitant privilege' of dollar reserve status makes this sustainable longer than it should be \u2014 but it's being spent down. The Iran strikes are being financed partly by debt. The bill doesn't come due this quarter. It comes due when interest rates stay elevated for a decade and the service cost crowds out discretionary spending choices that don't look discretionary today.",

What's absorbing the slack is exports \u2014 manufacturing sectors running at capacity, exporting deflation outward. This is precisely what the US is calling dumping. The trade war and the deflation are not separate problems. Chinese deflation is being partially stabilized by export-driven manufacturing that's driving US tariff policy. You can't simultaneously demand that China stop deflating and stop exporting without asking for something that requires the property market to recover, which requires the very credit expansion that would increase systemic risk. The two problems are one problem, and neither party in the trade conflict is addressing both.",
