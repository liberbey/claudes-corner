# Ad Creative Playbook: Casual Dice/Box Game

Built for a game with dice-rolling core loop, kingdom building, and a box-opening
heist mechanic (9 boxes, keys, prizes, risk/reward). Targeted at casual mobile
audience — primarily 25-45, social, plays in short sessions.

All numbers sourced from 2025-2026 industry data. All concepts are producible
with basic motion graphics or a single creator + screen recording.

## The 5 Formats to Run (Ranked by Priority)

### 1. Fail Run (Highest CTR potential)

**Why it works**: Viewers watch someone fail a simple task and think "I could do
better." The corrective urge is the strongest scroll-stopper in mobile gaming ads.
Fail should happen in first 3-5 seconds with exaggerated negative feedback.

**For this game**: The box-opening mechanic is perfect for fail ads. 9 boxes, limited
keys, the tension of picking wrong — it's built for this.

### 2. Player POV

**Why it works**: First-person gameplay that feels like playing, not watching an ad.
Almost always top-tier performance. Bypasses ad blindness entirely.

**For this game**: Screen recording of actual box opening sequence. Finger tapping
boxes. Dice rolling. Kingdom building. No narrator needed.

### 3. UGC-Style

**Why it works**: 4x higher CTR, 50% lower CPC vs polished creatives. Feels like a
friend showing you something, not a brand selling to you.

**For this game**: Creator reacting to box openings. "Watch what I got." The heist
mechanic generates natural reaction content.

### 4. Meme Bait

**Why it works**: Gets shared, stitched, duetted. Extends reach beyond paid budget
into organic. Best for TikTok/Reels.

**For this game**: The all-or-nothing nature of the heist (find all 3 prizes +
clear all 9 for x2) is inherently memeable.

### 5. Narrative Hook

**Why it works**: Story-driven opening → gameplay → payoff. Boosts retention
because users who install are emotionally invested, not just curious.

**For this game**: The "heist" framing is already a narrative. Lean into it.

## 10 Specific Creative Concepts

Each concept includes: hook (first 2 sec), body (10-20 sec), CTA, format, and
estimated production effort.

---

### Concept 1: "Wrong Box"
**Format**: Fail Run (video, 15 sec)
**Hook**: Hand taps a box → EMPTY. Red flash. Sad trombone. Text: "3 keys. 9 boxes. Choose wisely."
**Body**: Quick montage — tap box → empty, tap box → KEY (hope!), tap box → empty again. Counter shows "0 keys remaining." Dramatic zoom on the 6 unopened boxes.
**CTA**: "Can you find all 3 prizes?"
**Production**: Screen recording + motion graphics overlay. 1 day.
**Why it works**: Fail state in first 2 seconds. Corrective urge. Simple mechanics immediately understood.

---

### Concept 2: "The x2 Run"
**Format**: Player POV (video, 20 sec)
**Hook**: Text overlay: "What a PERFECT run looks like" — finger taps first box → PRIZE.
**Body**: Perfect sequence — every box opened, keys cascade, prizes stack up. All 9 boxes cleared. x2 MULTIPLIER flashes. Reward counter doubles. Satisfying sound design.
**CTA**: "Open your first box"
**Production**: Screen recording of a max-outcome path. Half a day.
**Why it works**: Aspirational. Shows the best possible outcome (16% probability). Players want to chase this.

---

### Concept 3: "My Boyfriend Spent My Keys"
**Format**: UGC + Narrative (video, 20 sec)
**Hook**: Creator talking to camera: "My boyfriend used all my keys and look what he left me—"
**Body**: Cut to game screen showing a kingdom with nothing built. Creator's voice: "So I started a heist." Quick gameplay montage of box opening, winning prizes, building. Cut back: "He's still not getting his phone back."
**CTA**: "Start your heist"
**Production**: 1 creator + screen recording. 1 day.
**Why it works**: Relationship drama hook (proven high engagement). UGC authenticity. Shows core loop naturally.

---

### Concept 4: "Key Management 101"
**Format**: Meme Bait (video, 15 sec)
**Hook**: Split screen. Left: "How I think I'll play" (confident face). Right: game screen showing 3 keys.
**Body**: Left: face gets progressively more stressed. Right: Box → empty. Box → empty. Last key. Left: full panic. Right: opens box → KEY +3! Left: instant relief. Then immediately → opens box → EMPTY. Left: dead inside.
**CTA**: "It's never that easy"
**Production**: Creator face + screen recording, basic editing. Half a day.
**Why it works**: Relatable emotional rollercoaster. Memeable format. Shows the game's tension loop.

---

### Concept 5: "One Key Left"
**Format**: Fail Run (video, 12 sec)
**Hook**: Close-up on screen: "1 KEY LEFT. 6 BOXES UNOPENED." Dramatic music.
**Body**: Finger hovers over boxes. Taps one. Pause. Box opens... KEY +2! New life. Opens next: PRIZE. Opens next: EMPTY. Opens next: PRIZE. One box left. Taps it—CUT TO BLACK.
**CTA**: "What's in the last box?"
**Production**: Screen recording + editing. Half a day.
**Why it works**: Cliffhanger. Curiosity gap is extreme. Forces install to resolve tension.

---

### Concept 6: "POV: You're a Box"
**Format**: Meme Bait (video, 10 sec)
**Hook**: Black screen. Text: "POV: you're a box in a heist game." A giant finger descends toward camera.
**Body**: Cut to game. Box opens: EMPTY. Cut to "box POV" — relief emoji. Another box gets picked. Cut to game — PRIZE. Cut to box POV — jealousy emoji. Another box: KEY +3. Box POV: "Oh no." Finger comes for this box. Tap. EMPTY.
**Text overlay**: "Survived another round 😮‍💨"
**CTA**: "How many empties can you dodge?"
**Production**: Basic motion graphics + game footage. 1 day.
**Why it works**: Novel perspective. Humor. Short enough for TikTok/Reels autoplay.

---

### Concept 7: "The Probability Guy"
**Format**: UGC (video, 25 sec)
**Hook**: Creator with glasses and a whiteboard: "So this game has a 16% chance of a PERFECT run. Let me test that."
**Body**: Plays the game. Narrates: "Ok, key box first... that's good. Empty — expected. Prize! That's P1..." Gets increasingly excited. Gets to box 7 of 9: "We're still alive!" Box 8: empty. Box 9: opens it... CUT.
**Text**: "Attempt 1 of 47."
**CTA**: "Beat the odds"
**Production**: 1 creator + screen recording. 1 day.
**Why it works**: Math/challenge hook. Creates a series (attempt 1, 2, 3...). Satisfies the "I can do better" urge.

---

### Concept 8: "Sound On 🔊"
**Format**: Player POV / ASMR (video, 15 sec)
**Hook**: Text: "Sound ON 🔊" — finger taps first box. Crisp, satisfying tap sound.
**Body**: Each box opening has a distinct, satisfying sound. Key jingle. Prize fanfare. Empty thud. Dice roll rumble. No music, no voice — just the sounds. Final box: massive reward cascade sound.
**CTA**: "Feel every box"
**Production**: Screen recording + sound design. 1 day.
**Why it works**: ASMR-adjacent content performs on TikTok/Reels. Sound-on hook signals "this is different." Sensory engagement.

---

### Concept 9: "Speed Run"
**Format**: Player POV (video, 12 sec)
**Hook**: Text: "Speedrun: all 9 boxes in 12 seconds." Timer starts.
**Body**: Rapid-fire box opening. No hesitation. Results flash: KEY, PRIZE, EMPTY, KEY, PRIZE, KEY, EMPTY, PRIZE, EMPTY. Timer hits 12 seconds. Text: "x2 BONUS — FULL CLEAR"
**CTA**: "How fast can you clear?"
**Production**: Sped-up screen recording. Half a day.
**Why it works**: Speed content is inherently watchable. Shows the full game loop in one quick burst. Low commitment ask.

---

### Concept 10: "What the Boxes See"
**Format**: Narrative Hook (video, 20 sec)
**Hook**: 9 boxes arranged in a grid, animated with tiny eyes. They whisper to each other: "Here they come again..."
**Body**: A key descends. Boxes panic. "Not me not me not me—" Key picks one. Box screams. Opens: EMPTY. Other boxes: "RIP Larry." Key picks another. This one has a prize inside — tries to hold it in, but the lid flies open. Reward cascades out.
**CTA**: "What's hiding in your boxes?"
**Production**: Simple character animation + game footage. 2-3 days.
**Why it works**: Anthropomorphized objects = proven engagement formula. Humor + narrative + game mechanic all in one. Can become a recurring character series.

---

## Playable Ad Concept

**Title**: "3 Keys, 9 Boxes"

**Mechanic**: Player gets 3 tappable keys. 9 boxes on screen. Tap a box to spend a key.
Outcomes are scripted to create the best experience:
- Box 1: KEY +2 (gives hope — now has 4 keys)
- Box 2: PRIZE (dopamine hit)
- Box 3: EMPTY (tension)
- Box 4: PRIZE (relief)
- Box 5: EMPTY (2 keys left, 4 boxes)

Screen fades: "Want to open the rest?" → App Store.

**Why it works**: Playables have the highest performance score of any format (191,
record high in 2025). This one is trivial to build — the box-opening mechanic is
simple tap interaction, no physics, no complex rendering. Cut CPI by 20-40%.

**Production**: 1-2 weeks for a playable ad vendor, or buildable in-house with
HTML5/JS.

---

## Creative Testing Framework

Don't guess. Test systematically.

**Week 1**: Launch 5 creatives (one per format type).
**Week 2**: Kill bottom 2, iterate on top 3.
**Week 3**: Launch 3 new variants of the winner + 2 new concepts.
**Week 4**: Repeat.

**Metrics to track**:
| Metric | Target (casual) |
|--------|----------------|
| CTR (video) | >1.5% |
| IPM (impressions per mille) | >25 |
| CPI (Android) | <$0.80 |
| CPI (iOS) | <$2.50 |
| D1 Retention | >35% |
| D7 ROAS | >7.5% |

Refresh >50% of creatives monthly. Creative fatigue is real — the average
top-performing creative lasts 2-3 weeks before declining.

---

## Production Priority

If starting from zero, build in this order:

1. **Concept 1 (Wrong Box)** + **Concept 5 (One Key Left)** — Fail runs, fastest to produce, highest CTR
2. **Playable Ad** — Highest long-term ROI, start the vendor/build process now
3. **Concept 2 (The x2 Run)** + **Concept 9 (Speed Run)** — Player POV, pure screen recordings
4. **Concept 3 (Boyfriend)** or **Concept 7 (Probability Guy)** — UGC, need a creator
5. **Concept 10 (What the Boxes See)** — Narrative, higher production but series potential
