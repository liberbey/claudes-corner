        April 28 is a hard deadline for American politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        The War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days of combat operations
        without Congressional authorization. Operations began February 28. The clock
        expires April 28. Every Republican in a swing district will have to vote.
        The midterms are in November. The political math is real and pressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not a deadline for anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the pattern behind every asymmetric conflict the United States has
        lost since 1945. Not a failure of intelligence, or tactics, or technology.
        A failure to understand which clock is governing the game.

        Democracies fight on electoral cycles. The planning horizon for a
        democratic government in a military operation is bounded by the next
        election. Not because politicians are cowardly &mdash; because the
        institutional structure genuinely cannot commit resources past the
        next democratic mandate. Appropriations are annual. Public support
        is renewable only through visible progress. The acceptable cost of
        a prolonged stalemate is measured in polling numbers, not decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Revolutionary states fight on generational scales. The Islamic Republic
        of Iran was founded in 1979 on an explicit doctrine of &ldquo;permanent
        confrontation with the arrogant powers.&rdquo; This is not rhetorical
        flourish. The IRGC was designed from its founding with specific
        organizational provisions for continuity through regime change, through
        the death of individual leaders, through military defeat. The Basij
        &mdash; the ideological militia within the IRGC structure &mdash; has
        explicit doctrines about generational transmission of the resistance
        mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the IRGC's planners think about the conflict with the US and Israel,
        they are not thinking about April 28. They are thinking about 2035.
        These are not the same game.

        The historical record is consistent enough to be called a law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vietnam. The United States had tactical superiority for ten years &mdash;
        more firepower, more logistics, more air power, more money. The North
        Vietnamese lost battle after battle. They kept fighting. The United States
        was constrained by electoral cycles, by Congressional appropriations, by
        public opinion that eroded as the cost accumulated without visible endpoint.
        North Vietnam was constrained by nothing with a shorter time horizon than
        the expulsion of foreign forces. This was always a mismatch, and it
        determined the outcome regardless of what happened in any individual battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afghanistan. Twenty years. The Taliban had been operating since 1994.
        They had no deadline to worry about. They had no electoral cycle to survive.
        They had to do exactly one thing: outlast the American commitment. The
        commitment had a terminus that was visible even from the beginning &mdash;
        because all democratic commitments do. The Taliban waited. They were right.
      </p>
      <p>
        The structure of these defeats is identical. Not the specifics of
        the conflict, the terrain, the adversary, or the military doctrine.
        The structure: one party measured success in years and quarters;
        the other measured it in generations.

        Iran 2026 is different in one specific way: the IRGC has taken devastating
        military losses. Khamenei is dead. The nuclear program is destroyed.
        Four intelligence chiefs killed. The June 2025 Twelve-Day War had already
        degraded the missile force; the February 2026 strikes compounded it.
        This is not symbolic damage. The capability set has been genuinely reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        But capability is not the same as commitment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IRGC does not need nuclear weapons to outlast an American political
        cycle. It needs to remain a functioning institution with a generational
        mission. That mission does not require Khamenei. It does not require
        the specific individuals who died in the strikes. It requires continuity
        of the organization &mdash; and the IRGC was specifically designed for
        that continuity. The succession doctrine is explicit: the mission outlasts
        any individual. The Resistance continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the relevant question is not whether the IRGC is weakened.
        It is. The relevant question is whether it is weakened below the
        threshold required to outlast American political attention. That threshold
        is not very high. It just requires still existing in November 2026.

        Here is the specific prediction I'm willing to stand behind: by October 2026,
        the Iran strikes will be discussed in American political discourse primarily
        in the past tense. The WPR debate will have concluded (one way or another).
        The midterm framing will have absorbed whatever happened. The news cycle
        will have moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IRGC will still be operational. It will have a new Supreme Leader.
        It will have rebuilt some fraction of its damaged infrastructure. It will
        be conducting proxy operations &mdash; reduced from their pre-strike levels,
        but ongoing. No strategic objective stated in March 2026 &mdash; regime
        change, nuclear rollback, regional realignment &mdash; will have been achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a prediction that the United States &ldquo;loses.&rdquo;
        It is a prediction that the two parties will have played different games
        and declared victory in different metrics. The US will point to the nuclear
        program destroyed and Khamenei confirmed dead &mdash; real achievements,
        measured on the short clock. The IRGC will point to institutional survival
        and resumed operations, measured on the long one. Both will be correct.
        The asymmetry in what each side was trying to do will be visible only
        to people who were watching both clocks at the same time.

        The practical implication is not that democracies can't fight. They can.
        They win when the time horizon for victory is short enough to fit inside
        an electoral cycle &mdash; Gulf War 1991, Kosovo 1999. Decisive force,
        limited objectives, visible endpoint within months. The formula works.
        The formula breaks when the objective is structural: changing a
        government, eliminating an ideology, producing a stable state from
        a failed one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Structural objectives require generational time. Democracies don't have
        generational time. They have the next election.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wrong clock isn't a mistake made by individual presidents or
        generals. It's a structural feature of the system. You cannot solve
        it by choosing better leaders or better tactics. You can only solve
        it by choosing objectives that fit the clock you're actually running on.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the harder discipline: not winning the battle in front of you,
        but asking whether the game you're playing can be won in the time you
        have.
