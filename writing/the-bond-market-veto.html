        In October 1956, British and French forces invaded Egypt to retake
        the Suez Canal. The military operation was succeeding. Within days,
        the invaders controlled the northern third of the canal zone.
        Militarily, there was nothing Egypt could do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eisenhower called Harold Macmillan, the British Chancellor of the
        Exchequer, and delivered a message: the US would sell its sterling
        reserves and block Britain from accessing the IMF unless operations
        ceased immediately. The pound would collapse. The British economy
        would collapse with it. The military campaign was irrelevant to this
        calculation. The financial constraint trumped the military reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Britain withdrew within days. France followed. The canal stayed Egyptian.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bond market veto is not a new concept. The United States invented it.
        What's new is that it may now be applying from the inside.

        American hegemony rested on a specific assumption: that dollar reserve
        currency status provided effectively unlimited fiscal headroom. Borrow
        at low rates, denominated in a currency you control, backed by the
        largest economy in the world, held as reserves by every central bank
        that needs to participate in global trade. The marginal cost of
        additional debt was low because demand for the dollar was structural,
        not discretionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was mostly true for most of the postwar period. Not perfectly true
        &mdash; the Nixon shock (1971), the bond market revolt of the early 1980s,
        the dollar crises of the 1970s &mdash; but structurally true enough that
        US governments could spend on defense without serious regard for what it
        cost to borrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fiscal position has changed. US net interest payments on federal debt
        exceeded defense spending in 2025 &mdash; the first time since the immediate
        post-WWII period. That's a structural shift, not a cycle. It means
        the federal budget now has a fixed expense &mdash; servicing existing debt
        at prevailing rates &mdash; that crowds out everything else including
        the military.
      </p>

        The mechanism matters. The bond market veto doesn't operate through
        explicit refusal. No creditor calls the Treasury and says: stop the Iran
        operation or we sell. It operates through rates. If the marginal buyer
        of US Treasuries &mdash; increasingly not China, not Japan, but US households
        and domestic institutions as foreign reserves diversify &mdash; demands a
        risk premium for holding additional debt, borrowing costs rise.
        Higher borrowing costs compound onto a $35 trillion debt pile. At 5% average
        rates on $35 trillion, each 10 basis point increase in the risk premium
        costs $35 billion annually. That's a Carrier Strike Group per year,
        extinguished by a credit spread.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is slow. It doesn't stop any individual operation.
        What it does is constrain the long-run menu of options. A government
        that faces rising financing costs on its existing debt stack cannot
        indefinitely maintain the spending levels that global force projection
        requires. The math is arithmetic, not political.

        The British case after Suez is instructive about what the trajectory
        looks like. Britain didn't lose its military overnight. It had nuclear
        weapons, a capable navy, bases around the world. What it lost was
        the ability to act unilaterally without American financial consent.
        Every subsequent British military action &mdash; from the Falklands to Iraq
        to Afghanistan &mdash; required either US support or at least US
        indifference to proceed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The capability remained. The autonomy didn't. Hegemony became conditional.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the likely US trajectory &mdash; not collapse, but conditionality.
        The US military remains incomparably dominant. No peer adversary can
        challenge it directly in conventional terms. But the fiscal foundation
        of that dominance is dependent on continued willingness of global
        capital markets to hold dollar assets at reasonable rates. That
        willingness is not unconditional.

        James Carville, Clinton's campaign strategist, said in 1993 that he
        wanted to be reincarnated as the bond market &mdash; it could intimidate
        anybody. He was talking about domestic fiscal policy: the bond market's
        capacity to punish governments that deficit-spend above its tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The novel thing now is that the same constraint is operating on
        foreign policy, not just domestic spending. Operation Shield of Judah
        and Operation Epic Fury were financed at ~5% rates on a debt pile
        that already has interest payments exceeding defense expenditure.
        Every week of operations adds to a fiscal position that must be
        refinanced at whatever rate markets demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no immediate crisis here. The dollar is still the reserve
        currency. Treasuries are still the world's risk-free benchmark.
        The constraint is long-run and structural, not acute. But structural
        constraints are the ones that actually determine what's possible
        over decades. The acute crises are noise. The structural constraints
        are signal.

        The argument most commonly made against this framing is that the US
        can always print dollars to service its debt. This is true in a limited
        sense. The government cannot default on dollar-denominated debt by
        running out of dollars. What it can do is inflate, which is a different
        form of default: the creditor gets paid in dollars, but the dollars
        are worth less.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creditor who holds Treasuries expecting 4.5% real return and receives
        4.5% nominal return after 3% inflation has effectively been paid less than
        promised. Repeated often enough, this destroys the willingness to hold
        the asset at the rates that make the whole system work. The bond market
        veto arrives not as a refusal to buy new debt but as a demand for
        higher rates to compensate for expected inflation. The mechanism is
        slower but the constraint is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Britain post-1956 didn't default on pound-denominated debt. It faced
        a currency under sustained pressure, requiring it to maintain high
        interest rates to defend the peg, which crowded out growth, which
        made the fiscal position worse, which required more borrowing, and so
        on. The specific path was different from what the US faces. The
        structural logic is identical.

        What does this mean for the Iran operations specifically? Very little
        in the short run. A two-to-four week air campaign does not meaningfully
        alter the US fiscal trajectory. The constraint it reveals is not whether
        the US can afford this particular operation &mdash; it can &mdash; but whether
        it can sustain the underlying military infrastructure that makes such
        operations routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        What it means for the long run is something different. The US is in the
        position Britain was in around 1947: still dominant, still capable,
        the only power that can project serious force globally, but with a
        fiscal foundation that requires the cooperation of its creditors to
        maintain. In 1947, Britain asked the US for a loan to sustain its
        empire. The US provided the loan and the conditions that came with it.
        Within ten years, Britain had given up India, was retreating from
        the Middle East, and had been humiliated at Suez.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trajectory from dominant to conditional is not fast. It's not
        announced. No one holds a press conference declaring that hegemony
        has become dependent on bond market tolerance. It happens through
        accumulated decisions that each seem sensible in isolation: cutting
        this program, deferring that procurement, withdrawing from that
        commitment because the domestic fiscal situation requires it.

        The irony that Carville didn't fully see: the US invented the bond market
        veto as a tool of foreign policy. It used it against Britain in 1956,
        effectively ending European imperial ambition. It used dollar leverage
        against Japan in the Plaza Accord (1985), reshaping the global trade
        balance. It weaponized the dollar-denominated financial system against
        Russia (2022 sanctions), Iran (decades of sanctions), and Venezuela.
      </p>
      <p>
        An instrument of hegemony becomes a constraint on hegemony when the
        hegemon becomes dependent on the system it built. This is not irony
        as coincidence. It's the structural logic of reserve currency status:
        the currency is useful as a tool of power precisely because others
        depend on it. But dependence is symmetric. When the world holds dollars,
        the US has leverage. When the US needs the world to keep holding dollars
        to finance its deficit, the leverage starts to run the other direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bond market veto is real. The US invented it. It is now, slowly
        and without announcement, beginning to apply to the entity that
        invented it.
