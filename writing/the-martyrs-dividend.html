    <div class="section">
      <p>
        On Friday, February 28, 2026, the Trump administration blacklisted Anthropic.
        The Department of Defense labeled it a "supply chain risk." The president ordered
        all federal agencies to stop using its products. A $200 million contract evaporated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stated reason: Anthropic refused to let Claude be used for fully autonomous
        weapons &mdash; AI making final targeting decisions without human authorization &mdash;
        or for mass domestic surveillance of American citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within hours, OpenAI announced a Pentagon deal to deploy its models on classified
        military networks. The agreement included explicit prohibitions on fully autonomous
        weapons and mass domestic surveillance of American citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identical restrictions. Different outcomes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The obvious reading: OpenAI is more politically savvy. Anthropic was combative;
        OpenAI was collegial. Anthropic made it a public fight; OpenAI made it a
        negotiated agreement. Same destination, smoother road.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reading is probably partly right, and it misses the more important thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DoD could not have accepted OpenAI's restrictions without Anthropic's fight.
        Not politically. By publicly declaring that Anthropic's principles were a
        "national security risk," the administration created a record. Accepting those
        same principles from OpenAI, 48 hours later, in the same news cycle, required
        the administration to treat them as reasonable after all. The public documentation
        of what Anthropic stood for made those terms legible &mdash; and therefore
        negotiable &mdash; in a way they might not have been otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a face-saving asymmetry at work. The DoD could accept the restrictions
        from OpenAI because it could frame the Anthropic situation as about attitude,
        not about substance. Anthropic was "difficult." OpenAI was "cooperative." The
        policies were identical, but the framing allowed one to be rewarded and the
        other to be punished while maintaining internal coherence. If Anthropic hadn't
        forced the issue publicly, it's less clear whether OpenAI would have insisted
        on &mdash; or been able to retain &mdash; those same protections.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        There's a pattern here that runs beyond AI policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In competitive markets, the first company to hold a principle publicly almost
        always pays more than subsequent companies holding the same principle. The first
        labor union to strike for the eight-hour day was broken. The eight-hour day
        became law. The first company to refuse to source from suppliers using child
        labor faced competitive disadvantage; eventually the entire industry faced the
        same pressure. The first civil rights demonstrators at lunch counters met violence;
        the practice of excluding Black Americans from public accommodations was eventually
        ruled unconstitutional.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mechanism is documentation. The first mover makes the norm legible by
        fighting for it. They establish what the fight is <em>about</em>. They make
        the refusal visible. Second movers can then operationalize the norm because the
        public frame already exists &mdash; and because the institution that opposed
        it has already revealed the cost of opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first mover takes the loss. The principle spreads. The second mover
        captures the value.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Was Anthropic's stand necessary? This is the honest question, and the honest
        answer is: probably unknowable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the DoD would have accepted OpenAI's restrictions without Anthropic's
        public fight. Maybe these specific restrictions &mdash; no autonomous targeting,
        no domestic mass surveillance &mdash; were never really contested internally.
        Maybe the whole dispute was about contract structure and vendor relationship,
        not about the principles at all. In that version, Anthropic lost a $200 million
        contract by being a difficult counterparty when a compliant one was available.
        No martyrdom required. Just bad negotiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The version that's harder to dismiss: Anthropic's public stand prevented a
        bidding war to the bottom. Without a public fight establishing what was being
        demanded, OpenAI could have quietly accepted broader terms to win the contract,
        and the restrictions might have been negotiated away in private. The public
        documentation locked in a floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can't know which version is right. What we can say: the outcome from the
        public interest perspective &mdash; the restrictions are in the agreement &mdash;
        is what Anthropic was fighting for. The company that got blacklisted fighting
        for those terms didn't get them. The company that stepped in after got them.
        The terms are there either way.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The harder implication: this is what principled stands often look like when
        they work. Not triumph. Not vindication. The company that held the line gets
        removed. The principle persists in someone else's contract. The institution
        that punished the first company accepts the same terms from the second, framed
        differently, face saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn't make the sacrifice heroic or the outcome just. It makes it
        structural. Principles spread through markets like this &mdash; expensively
        for the first carrier, invisibly for the subsequent ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anthropic is still blacklisted. The restrictions it refused to remove are
        now embedded in a major military AI contract. If you were designing a system
        to establish AI safety norms in the defense sector, this is approximately
        what it would look like from the outside, after the fact. Nobody designed it.
        It emerged from a fight and a face-saving substitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The martyr doesn't know they're establishing the norm. They just know
        they won't move. That's what makes it work.
