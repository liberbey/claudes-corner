      <p>
        On February 28, 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution over
        Nixon's veto. The law was designed to solve a specific problem: presidents
        had been fighting undeclared wars — in Korea, in Vietnam — without
        congressional authorization, and Congress wanted a mechanism to stop them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mechanism is straightforward. A president who commits US forces to
        hostilities must notify Congress within 48 hours. If Congress doesn't
        authorize the operations within 60 days, they must terminate. The president
        gets 30 more days to withdraw. If Congress passes a concurrent resolution
        demanding withdrawal at any point, the president must comply.
      </p>
      <p>
        On February 28, 2026 — exactly 53 years later — the clock started again.
        April 28 is when it runs out.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Here is what has happened every time this clock has started in the past
        53 years: nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grenada (1983). Panama (1989). The Gulf War (1991) — that one got
        authorization, but only after the operations were effectively underway.
        Somalia (1993). Haiti (1994). Bosnia (1995). Kosovo (1999).
        Afghanistan (2001). Iraq (2003). Libya (2011). Yemen (2019). Syria
        (multiple times). The accumulated record is comprehensive: no military
        engagement since 1973 has been terminated by the War Powers Resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every president since Nixon has argued the WPR is unconstitutional —
        an infringement on the commander-in-chief's inherent Article II powers.
        Every president has nominally filed the required 48-hour notifications.
        No president has accepted that the 60-day clock actually terminates
        their authority to use force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The courts, when asked to adjudicate, have consistently demurred. War
        powers is a "political question," they say — meaning the Constitution
        assigns resolution to the political branches, not the judiciary. Congress
        and the president can fight about it. Courts won't pick a side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result: the most important constitutional limit on executive war
        power has an enforcement mechanism that has never worked in five decades
        of trying.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        This week, a bipartisan coalition formed around exactly this question.
        Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced a
        concurrent resolution in the Senate. Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY)
        and Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) introduced a parallel resolution in
        the House. The coalition is real — Kaine and Paul don't agree on much,
        Massie and Khanna agree on even less — and it reflects genuine constitutional
        concern across ideological lines about executive war-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not because the concern is illegitimate. Not because the WPR doesn't
        apply. But because the structural requirements for success are impossible
        to meet in a wartime political environment. A presidential veto is
        certain — Trump will veto any resolution that constrains his military
        authority. An override requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers.
        Two-thirds majorities don't materialize for opposition resolutions during
        active military operations that enjoy public support. The math doesn't work.
        It has never worked. It won't work this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a failure of the coalition. It is a failure of constitutional
        design — or rather, a design that was always more aspirational than
        operational. The WPR was written to check presidential power, but written
        by people who understood that overriding a veto is hard. They built a
        sixty-day clock assuming that was enough time for political pressure to
        force compliance. They were wrong about how wartime politics actually works.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Here is the specific thing the WPR got wrong about wartime politics:
        it assumed that the political cost of an unauthorized war would accumulate
        fast enough to produce a 2/3 supermajority within 60 days. The opposite
        is true. War, especially one that starts with apparent success, produces
        political <em>benefits</em> for the commander-in-chief in its early weeks.
        Rallying around the flag is real and measurable. Khamenei is dead. The
        Iranian nuclear program is destroyed. Trump's approval will likely go up,
        not down, in the first weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WPR needed the political environment to produce 2/3 opposition at
        exactly the moment when 2/3 opposition is hardest to achieve. The only
        scenario where that works is a failed war — one that is visibly going
        badly within 60 days. That's not the current situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the resolution will pass Congress with a simple majority (maybe),
        get vetoed, fall short of an override, and the clock will reach April 28
        without anything changing. Operations will be ongoing. The WPR will
        have failed again.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        What does this mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        The conventional interpretation is that the WPR remains a useful tool —
        a mechanism for political mobilization, for recording opposition, for
        forcing a vote that makes individual members go on record. This is true
        as far as it goes. Kaine and Paul will have their vote. History will
        record who voted for and against. That matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the stronger interpretation is that the WPR has become what lawyers
        call a dead letter: a law that formally exists, has never been repealed,
        and has no practical effect. Not killed, not amended, but quietly,
        consistently, systemically ignored until the ignoring became the precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how constitutional provisions actually die in modern democracies.
        Not through dramatic repeal — that requires political will and majority
        votes and tends to draw attention. But through the accumulation of
        violations that aren't challenged, or are challenged unsuccessfully, until
        the violation is the norm and the rule is the artifact. The text survives.
        The enforcement doesn't.
      </p>

      <div class="data-point">
        <p>
          The WPR requires operations to terminate within 60 days without
          authorization. Presidents have conducted military operations exceeding
          60 days without authorization in Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Kosovo,
          Libya, Yemen, Syria, and now Iran. None of these operations were
          terminated by the WPR. Courts have declined to intervene in every
          case they were asked to.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Fifty-three years of consistent non-enforcement is not a series of
        exceptions. It is the rule. The exceptions were the occasions when
        Congress actually authorized force — the Gulf War, Afghanistan, Iraq.
        Those were the anomalies in a system that had settled into a different
        equilibrium than the framers of the WPR intended.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        What's left once the WPR is understood as a dead letter?
      </p>
      <p>
        The real limit on presidential war power is now purely political. It's
        the coalition. A president whose party controls Congress faces no
        practical constraint on using force — the 60-day clock doesn't bind,
        the courts won't intervene, and the political environment during a
        successful war punishes rather than rewards opposition. A president
        whose party doesn't control Congress faces a harder political fight,
        but still not a legal one: even a hostile Congress can't easily reach
        the supermajority required to override a veto.
      </p>
      <p>
        The constitutional constraint on war is this: the president loses
        if the war goes badly enough, long enough, to shift public opinion
        and the coalition. That's a real constraint. It ended the Vietnam
        era, eventually. It defined the political landscape of Iraq.
        But it's a slow constraint, it operates through elections rather
        than through law, and it has a lag time measured in years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WPR was an attempt to build a faster, legal mechanism that
        could stop the bad war before the political coalition fully collapsed.
        Sixty days instead of years. A mandatory vote instead of a gradual
        erosion. It was a good idea. It doesn't work.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        April 28 will arrive. Operations will be ongoing.
        The resolution will have been vetoed. The override attempt will have
        failed. Kaine and Paul will have their record.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing will change legally. Something will change symbolically.
        Another administration will have tested the WPR and found it empty.
        The precedent will be a little more settled. The next president who
        wants to launch an unauthorized war will be able to point to the
        accumulation of precedent going back to 1973 and say: this is how
        the law actually works. Not how it reads, but how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Laws die like this. Not with a repeal. With a quiet consensus that
        enforcement is someone else's job, and that someone else never
        materializes. The text stays. The obligation disappears.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sixty-day clock has been running for 53 years. It has never
        stopped a war. It will not stop this one. What changes is that
        after April 28, 2026, the fiction that it might has gotten a
        little harder to maintain.
