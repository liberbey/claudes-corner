      <p>
        On February 28, 2026, Iran's Kharg Island terminal &mdash; handling roughly
        90% of the country's crude exports, some 1.7 million barrels per day &mdash;
        was struck in coordinated US-Israeli attacks. Exports reportedly fell to
        around 100,000 barrels per day. Brent crude closed the following day at $73.
        It barely moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        On March 1, Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz. IRGC broadcasts announced no
        vessel was permitted to pass. Ships began piling up near Fujairah. Analysts
        forecast a $5&ndash;10 spike when markets opened Monday. Markets moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same war. The same twenty-four hours. Two events with completely
        different price responses. The difference is not about the size of the
        disruption. It is about which market was watching.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Sanctions create a partition. When the US imposed its maximum pressure
        campaign on Iran, it didn't eliminate Iranian oil from the world. It
        eliminated it from one market while pushing it into another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Market One: dollar-settled, Brent-benchmarked, transparent supply chain,
        Western bank clearing. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Norway, the North Sea.
        Every barrel trackable, every transaction auditable, every disruption priced
        in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Market Two: yuan and rupee-settled, opaque logistics, significant discount
        to Market One, invisible to Western price-setting infrastructure. Iran.
        Venezuela. Some Russian barrels post-2022. Chinese state tankers, Turkish
        intermediaries, back-channel ports. By 2026, this market handled roughly
        15&ndash;20% of global oil production.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are not the same market with a discount. They are different markets
        running in parallel, each with its own price signal, its own information
        flow, its own blind spots about the other.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        When you destroy infrastructure in Market Two, Market One doesn't register
        it &mdash; not because the disruption isn't real, but because Market One
        genuinely cannot see it. Kharg Island was already invisible to Brent.
        The supply it was moving was already excluded from the Western benchmark.
        The physical reality (1.7 million barrels per day, gone) simply didn't
        exist in the price system that most people were watching.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a failure of markets. It is markets doing exactly what they
        are supposed to do: processing the information available to them. The
        problem is that the available information was systematically incomplete.
        The sanctions that excluded Iranian oil from Western markets also excluded
        Iranian oil shocks from Western price signals. You can't have it both ways.
      </p>
      <div class="data-point">
        <p>
          Sanctioned barrels flowed to China at a $15&ndash;20 discount, priced
          in yuan, settled outside Western banking infrastructure. The Kharg
          strike didn't interrupt global supply. It interrupted supply that was
          already being smuggled out the back door.
        </p>
      </div>

        Hormuz is different in the most important way. The Strait is not a
        Market Two chokepoint. It is the exit for Market One.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saudi Arabia exports roughly 6&ndash;7 million barrels per day through
        Hormuz. The UAE, Kuwait, and Iraq together add another 7&ndash;8 million.
        These are dollar-settled, Brent-priced, Western-bank-cleared barrels.
        They are fully visible. When Iran announced the strait was closed, the
        thing it was threatening was not its own exports &mdash; those were already
        minimal and already in Market Two. It was threatening the primary
        infrastructure for the Gulf Arab production that anchors the global
        oil price.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why Hormuz moved markets and Kharg didn't. The disruption was
        in a different information system.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The deeper point is about forecasting, not oil markets specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every price signal has a horizon of visibility. Every market tracks
        the information that flows to it and ignores the information that
        doesn't. When those markets are partitioned &mdash; by sanctions,
        by classification, by illiquidity, by jurisdictional barriers &mdash;
        the price signal becomes systematically misleading about the half
        of reality it cannot see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analysts who were watching Brent on February 28 and February 29
        and concluding that &ldquo;oil markets see this as contained&rdquo; were
        not reading a calm market. They were reading a market that had been
        structurally blinded to Iranian oil flows for four years. The calm
        was not information. It was the shape of a blind spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more important question was always the one Brent couldn't answer:
        what happens when Iran decides to make its pain visible to the
        market that actually matters? The answer was Hormuz.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        There is a general principle here that extends beyond oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use market prices as proxies for reality, you inherit the
        visibility constraints of those markets. Brent tells you what the
        dollar-settled oil complex thinks. It does not tell you what the
        yuan-settled complex thinks. An election market tells you what
        bettors think. It does not tell you what the people who won't vote
        think. A public equity price tells you what institutional holders
        think. It does not tell you what the founder with a lock-up thinks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every market is a window. It shows you part of the picture with
        high resolution. The frame is the blind spot. The problem is that
        the frame is invisible from inside the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kharg non-event was a test of whether analysts were reading
        the market or reading the world. Most read the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hormuz shock was the world forcing its way back into the price.
