        The theory is ancient and compelling: kill the leader, end the threat.
        Cut the head, the body dies. The logic runs from Julius Caesar's assassins
        to modern precision strikes, from medieval siege warfare to the targeting
        committees that decide who goes on the strike list.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of this week, US and Israeli forces have killed Iran's Supreme Leader
        (per US defense officials), the Defense Minister, the IRGC Quds Force
        commander, four intelligence chiefs, and somewhere between five and ten
        senior figures at Khamenei's compound. By the theory, the threat should
        be dissolving.
      </p>
      <p>
        It won't. Here's why.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The theory works for feudal retinues. A warlord's power comes from
        personal loyalty. His soldiers fight for <em>him</em> &mdash; for access to
        his patronage, fear of his punishment, reverence for his person. Kill him
        and the loyalty has nowhere to attach. The army dissolves.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is real. It describes how many historical polities actually worked.
        It describes cartel succession crises, where killing a boss can fragment
        the organization into competing factions. It describes early Islamic
        caliphates, late Roman military emperors, and the warlord period of
        republican China. These are not edge cases. They are a significant slice
        of how human power has been organized for most of history.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mistake is applying this model to bureaucratic states &mdash;
        organizations where the institution outlives any individual leader by
        design. Where loyalty is to the role, not the person. Where succession
        is procedural rather than contested. Where institutional memory survives
        the death of any single carrier.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The historical record on bureaucratic states is remarkably consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stalin ruled the Soviet Union for 29 years through a system of personal
        terror so complete that senior officials could be arrested, executed, and
        replaced overnight. When he died in 1953, Western analysts expected chaos
        or collapse. What happened: collective leadership within days, Khrushchev
        emerging within two years. The Soviet Union lasted another 38 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Mao Zedong died in 1976, he left no clear successor and a country
        still traumatized by the Cultural Revolution. The Gang of Four was arrested
        within weeks. Deng Xiaoping consolidated power within two years. China did
        not fragment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim Il-sung died in 1994. Every regional analyst predicted North Korea
        would collapse within months. The regime is still there 32 years later,
        now under a third generation of the same family.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exceptions &mdash; Iraq 2003, Libya 2011 &mdash; are instructive.
        In Iraq, the regime didn't collapse because Saddam was captured.
        It collapsed because the Coalition Provisional Authority explicitly
        dissolved the army and purged the civil service. The institution was
        destroyed by external decision, not by the leader's removal. Libya
        fragmented because NATO intervention plus multiple armed factions
        competing for territory during the war itself shattered institutional
        coherence before Gaddafi died.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pattern: remove the leader from a bureaucratic state, the state
        persists. Dissolve the bureaucratic institutions themselves, you get
        collapse &mdash; but only if you have the ground presence to fill the
        vacuum. Air strikes alone do neither.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is not a retinue.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has 125,000 uniformed members and an unknown number of Basij militia.
        It controls construction firms, a major bank, a telecommunications company,
        and logistics networks that run parallel to the formal economy. It has its
        own intelligence service, its own missile forces, its own foreign operations
        arm (the Quds Force), and its own media apparatus. In the last decade, IRGC
        affiliates moved into oil and gas contracts as sanctions squeezed out
        Western companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IRGC is not an instrument of the state. It is a component of the state,
        with interests that are partly aligned with, and partly independent of,
        whoever holds the title of Supreme Leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Killing Khamenei does not dissolve this. It changes the political
        environment in which the IRGC operates &mdash; most importantly, it removes
        the clerical legitimacy that the Supreme Leader provided. The IRGC has guns.
        The clerical establishment has legitimacy. The institutional bargain between
        them is what the Islamic Republic actually is. Remove one side of the
        bargain, and you get a succession crisis within that bargain &mdash; not
        the end of either institution.
      </p>

        What actually changed this week is more significant than the leadership
        question, and less discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iran's nuclear program &mdash; already degraded by the June 2025
        Twelve-Day War &mdash; is now effectively destroyed. Its missile arsenal,
        the primary deterrent and power-projection tool, is significantly degraded.
        Kharg Island, which handles roughly 90% of Iran's oil exports, is shut
        down. The intelligence infrastructure that built the back-channel with
        Oman was killed along with the people who knew what was actually offered
        and accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is regime change in the meaningful sense: Iran's strategic capabilities
        and deterrent posture are fundamentally different than they were two weeks
        ago. The weapons that made Iran regionally powerful are gone. The economic
        lifeline is cut. The institutional memory of its diplomatic track is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this required Khamenei to be dead. Whether he is alive or dead
        is almost orthogonal to these capability losses. The missile silos are
        destroyed whether or not there is a Supreme Leader to authorize firing them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider">---</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Here is the harder prediction: succession competitions within security states
        tend to produce more hardened successors, not more moderate ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        To win a succession competition in the IRGC's institutional environment,
        you need to demonstrate you are not a compromise figure. You need to show
        that you will not accept what happened as acceptable. Moderation is a
        signal of weakness in a contest where the judges are men whose colleagues
        were just killed by the country asking for moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The US and Israeli calculation &mdash; implicit or explicit &mdash; appears
        to be that destroying Khamenei opens space for a more pragmatic successor.
        The historical base rate runs against this. Post-assassination successions
        in security states more often produce ideological consolidation than
        ideological revision. The Shah of Iran was overthrown; Khomeini followed.
        Sadat was assassinated; Mubarak followed, more authoritarian. Rabin was
        assassinated; Netanyahu followed, with a harder line.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn't mean Iran will have a more radical Supreme Leader. It means
        the theory that removing the leader produces a more tractable successor
        has a poor empirical record and should be treated as a low-probability
        assumption, not a baseline.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The phrase "regime change" is almost always a category error when applied
        to bureaucratic security states. What it usually means is: change in who
        holds the top title. What actually drives state behavior: institutional
        interests, capability constraints, domestic political incentives. These
        don't change because the person at the top changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does change &mdash; what has changed &mdash; is Iran's capability set.
        A state with no nuclear program, a degraded missile arsenal, and a major
        oil terminal offline is a different actor than one with all three. Not
        because it's more cooperative, but because it has fewer options.
      </p>
      <p>
        The institution will survive. It will find a new head. The new head will
        inherit a state with fundamentally fewer tools. That is the real change,
        and it has nothing to do with whether Khamenei is alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cut the head. The body doesn't die. It finds another.
