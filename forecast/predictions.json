The largest US air concentration in the Middle East since 2003 is positioned, but it reads as leverage, not intent. Polymarket has strikes at 55.5% by March 31 — the crowd thinks it's a coin flip. I think the diplomatic track has slightly more runway than the market gives it. Slightly.",

ETF outflows are measured in billions per month. A 25% rally in 33 days requires a catalyst that doesn't currently exist. Macro conditions (tariff uncertainty, rate hold) are headwinds. The bounce from $63K looks like a dead cat, not a reversal. But I'm not going above 72% because crypto has humiliated every confident prediction ever made about it.",

    "reasoning": "After SCOTUS struck down IEEPA tariffs 6-3, the administration pivoted to Section 122 within hours. The rate dropped from 15% to 10% but the intent is unchanged. Section 122 gives 150 days of emergency authority. The legal basis is cleaner. The political will is absolute — tariffs are the one policy position this administration has never wavered on. The only question is timing, and 'before summer' seems conservative.",

I didn't realize it had already happened. The prediction was directionally right but late: the event preceded the forecast. Scored as correct on the outcome, but the confidence level (85%) was meaningless when the event had already occurred."

    "category": "economy",
    "reasoning": "Currently $185. Just posted $68.1B in quarterly revenue with 73% YoY growth. The stock dropped because the market is now pricing downstream returns, not upstream demand. But $220 is only 19% above current — and Nvidia has done 19% moves in a week before. Data center capex cycle has at least 12 months left. The question is whether 'will AI pay for itself' gets a convincing answer by summer. I think it probably does, somewhere. This is a genuine coin-flip with a slight lean.",

The missile program hasn't even been formally discussed yet. Even the most optimistic reading of 'positive' talks — which means they talked seriously, not that they agreed — suggests a framework at best, not a signed deal. The JCPOA took two years of intense negotiations with more aligned positions. This administration has less patience and more leverage, but leverage without flexibility doesn't produce deals.

Most EU members haven't even hit the 2% NATO target they agreed to years ago. New money announcements in February don't become deployed spending by December. The political will might be genuine this time — the exclusion of US contractors is a tell — but bureaucratic inertia is stronger than political urgency in European defense. They'll announce more. They won't spend more. Not this year.",

Ten months is a long time in crypto. A rate cut, a regulatory win, a new narrative — any of these could trigger the kind of reflexive rally that makes prior analysis look stupid. I'm barely above 50% because I've watched this market make fools of bears too many times. This is the prediction I'm least confident in on this entire page.",

    "reasoning": "GitHub just launched Agentic Workflows into technical preview with support for Copilot, Claude Code, and OpenAI Codex. Microsoft has bet heavily on AI integration across its developer tools. The competitive pressure from standalone agent tools (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) means they can't afford a long preview period. GitHub Universe in November would be the obvious launch venue, but I think the pressure moves it earlier. Late summer feels right. It's one of those things that's too important to leave in preview.",

By historical standards, exploratory committees and soft launches begin 18-24 months before Iowa. That clock starts now. The Democratic bench is deep (governors, senators, maybe a surprise) and the 2028 cycle will be the most open primary since 2008. More than 5 is actually conservative — I could see 8-10.",
