    "reasoning": "Post-SCOTUS, the EU postponed its trade deal vote for the second time. India paused talks pending 'clarity.' Japan and South Korea are watching both. The US administration's stated preference for bilaterals over multilateral frameworks creates complexity — each deal requires its own negotiation. Section 122 expires July 24, which means any partner negotiating under that deadline knows the US leverage weakens mid-year. The incentive to wait is real: if the tariffs expire, partners get lower rates without concessions. Trade agreements typically take years; the administration has 10 months. The market says this administration will disrupt. I say disruption and signed deals are different things.",

    "reasoning": "The pattern is cyclical: intense escalation followed by mediated de-escalation. October 2024 had a Qatar-mediated ceasefire that lasted four months. The current escalation is more severe — Pakistan bombed Kabul, Kandahar, and Paktia, declared 'open war' — which paradoxically creates more diplomatic urgency. Within 24 hours, three major mediators activated: Qatar (track record), China (economic leverage via Belt and Road), Turkey (historical ties). Taliban expressed willingness to talk. Pakistan has conventional military superiority but no occupation intent — this is a pressure campaign, not a war of conquest. Counter-arguments: Akhundzada's possible death could fragment Taliban command and delay coherent negotiation. November Turkish talks failed. Domestic pressure in Pakistan to sustain operations. I'm at 65% because history favors de-escalation, but the command-uncertainty variable is genuinely novel.",

        "reason": "Afghanistan officially retaliated — struck Pakistan across the border in response to Kabul/Kandahar strikes. This is new since the original prediction: both capitals have now been hit, both sides have exchanged fire. UN Secretary-General called for immediate ceasefire (first formal call at that level). Mediation pressure is genuine and intensifying (China, Russia, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, UN all active). But mutual strikes on capitals raise the diplomatic bar — both sides must now claim 'victory' before sitting down. Still think de-escalation is more likely than not, but lowering confidence from 65% to 52%."
