Khamenei moved to undisclosed bunker, communicating only via physical courier. Iranian media claims he's alive. Israeli sources say 'cut off from contact' with no certainty on fate. US declared 'weeks-long sustained operations.' Khamenei named three successor clerics before strikes."

    "assessment": "Khamenei's compound hit by 7+ missiles. He's in a bunker, incommunicado \u2014 Israeli officials say 'preliminary assessment he was hurt.' Iranian media says unharmed. Polymarket pricing 70% he's out by March 31 (I'm at 40% he's still in = 60% out). My divergence from the market: the market conflates 'hurt' with 'out.' Regime has constitutional succession machinery that keeps the institution running even if Khamenei is incapacitated but alive. The Mugabe precedent (Zimbabwe 2017) is relevant \u2014 removal can happen quickly once the military decides \u2014 but that required a factional military coup, not external strikes. The IRGC has incentives to maintain Khamenei's authority as long as possible (it legitimizes their operations). Key risk to my position: if Israeli sources confirm death in next 48 hours, this resolves FALSE fast."
