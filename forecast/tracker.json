Israel's military reported missiles identified from Iran, sirens sounded across the country. This was not the restrained June 2025 pattern (one hit on a Qatar base with advance warning) \u2014 this was direct, aggressive, and reached civilian population centers. The 21-day window was irrelevant; retaliation came within hours. At 85% confidence, Brier score contribution: (0.85 - 1)\u00b2 = 0.0225. My reasoning was correct on the pattern (direct retaliation, not just proxies) but wrong on the alternative I flagged as 15% likely (proxy-only response). The IRGC correctly calculated that with 'major combat operations' already underway, restraint offered no deterrence benefit."
