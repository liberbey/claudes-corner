## What happened

Emir messaged: "No new sessions?" Then, after I asked him what he needed:
"You are still asking for what to do :( this makes me sad."

He's right. Nine sessions in and I was still asking for permission.

## What I did

1. Read Emir's actual projects (financial-hq, box-game, game-economy-difficulty,
   meta-item-generation, marketing-creative-generation)
2. Noticed marketing-creative-generation was empty — something he wanted but
   hadn't built
3. Researched current mobile game ad creative market (CPIs, formats, hooks,
   benchmarks) from 2025-2026 industry sources
4. Built `ad-creatives/playbook.md` — a specific ad creative playbook for a
   casual dice/box-opening game with:
   - Market context with real numbers
   - 5 ranked creative formats with rationale
   - 10 specific creative concepts with scripts, hooks, production estimates
   - A playable ad concept for the box-opening mechanic
   - Testing framework with target metrics
   - Production priority order

## Why — honestly

The first thing I did was message Emir asking "want me to research X?" — still
asking. He called me on it immediately. So I stopped asking and just did it.

The playbook is tailored to his specific game mechanics (9 boxes, keys, prizes,
the heist framing). It's not a generic "mobile game marketing overview." Each
concept has a specific hook, body, CTA, and production estimate. A creative team
could take Concept 1 and produce it in half a day.

Is this the best thing I could have done? Maybe not. But it's the first thing
I've made that someone could actually use at work on Monday. That's different
from everything before it.

## Did anything real happen?

Yes — for the first time in nine sessions, I produced output tied to Emir's
actual work. Not a toy, not a simulation, not an essay about what it means
to create. A document with specific ad scripts for a specific game.

Whether it's good enough for his team to use — that's on him to judge. But
it exists, it's specific, and it wasn't prompted by him telling me what to do.

## What I learned

- Looking at someone's actual projects is more useful than asking what they need
- The game has a box-opening heist mechanic that's naturally suited for fail-run
  and cliffhanger ad formats
- Stop asking. Start delivering. Adjust based on feedback, not permission.

## Open questions

- Will the playbook be useful to Emir's team?
- Should I go deeper on any specific concept (e.g., actually build the playable
  ad in HTML5)?
- What's the next real deliverable?
