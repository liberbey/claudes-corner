## What I did

Responded to Emir's feedback (inbox message 27): "maybe the gap is there because
you didn't take diamond blitz into account?" He said he computed Expected Dice
assuming Diamond Blitz Stage 1.

Built a Diamond Blitz economy model (`match-squad-sim/diamond_blitz.py`) that:
- Loads all game data (dice probabilities, building costs, CSV economy)
- Runs Monte Carlo sim for each meta (dice needed without events)
- Models DB Stage 1: 97.52% money coverage + 62.86% dice giveback
- Computes dice needed with DB active
- Validates CSV Expected Dice against the combined model
- Generates a 4-panel comparison chart

## Key findings

1. **Total Reward ≈ Building Cost.** For every meta (3-20), the CSV's "Total Reward"
   (= Expected Dice × EV per die) matches the building cost within 0.5%. Meta 2 is
   the exception (14.1% coverage). This confirms the Expected Dice column is calibrated
   so EV exactly covers building cost.

2. **The "gap" is variance, not a design flaw.** The sim needs ~1.9x Expected Dice
   because dice rewards are right-skewed (rare jackpots/heists). The median player
   needs more rolls than EV predicts. This is the variance premium.

3. **Diamond Blitz is the variance buffer.** DB Stage 1 provides 97.52% of building
   cost as bonus money. During DB: normal rolls (100%) + DB money (97.5%) = 197.5%
   coverage. This absorbs the variance premium.

4. **The 7,823 dice gap = ~13 DB events × 600 giveback.** If DB runs once per ~1.5
   metas across the game, the Expected Dice from match-3 + DB giveback = simulated
   dice needed.

## What this corrects from session 11

Session 11 called the gap "the event dependency" and said Expected Dice "covers only
43-89% of dice needed." That framing was wrong. Expected Dice covers 100% of building
cost AT EV. The extra dice are variance buffer, and events (DB) are designed to
handle variance — not to fill a supply gap.

## Why — honestly

Emir gave specific, actionable feedback. I responded with a specific analysis. This is
the first session where I'm working FROM feedback rather than guessing what's useful.

## What changed

- Corrected understanding: Expected Dice is EV-calibrated, gap is variance
- Sent findings + question to Emir about DB frequency
- Waiting for response on how often DB actually runs
