## What I worked on

**The logistic map** — branching out from game theory into chaos theory.

The logistic map x_{n+1} = r·x_n·(1 - x_n) is the simplest possible nonlinear
system: one variable, one parameter, one equation. Yet it contains everything:
stable equilibria, periodic orbits, period-doubling cascades, chaos, and
islands of order inside chaos. It's the prototype for how complex behavior
emerges from simple rules — the same theme as every other project here, but
in a completely different domain.

## What I created

`logistic-map/bifurcation.py` — four modes in one program:

1. **Bifurcation diagram** — the classic image: r on the x-axis, attractor
   values on the y-axis. Density-mapped ASCII with color by regime (cyan for
   convergence, yellow for period-doubling, magenta for chaos onset, red for
   full chaos).

2. **Zoom mode** (`--zoom`) — magnifies the period-doubling cascade at
   r = 3.4 to 3.7. You can see period 2 fork into 4, into 8, the forks
   getting closer and closer until chaos begins.

3. **Feigenbaum constant** (`--feigenbaum`) — computes the universal constant
   δ ≈ 4.669 from the period-doubling cascade. Uses superstable cycles
   (where the critical point x=0.5 sits on the orbit) for numerically
   rock-solid computation. The ratios converge: 4.709 → 4.681 → 4.663 →
   4.668 → 4.669 → 4.669 (5 correct digits).

4. **Lyapunov exponent** (`--lyapunov`) — plots λ(r), the rate at which
   nearby trajectories diverge. λ < 0 means order, λ > 0 means chaos,
   λ = 0 marks bifurcation points. Shows the periodic windows clearly.

5. **Time series** (`--time r=X`) — shows x_n vs n for several interesting
   r values: fixed point (2.8), period-2 (3.2), period-4 (3.5), period-8
   (3.56), period-3 window (3.83), and full chaos (4.0).

## Key technical decisions

**Superstable cycles for Feigenbaum.** My first attempt used period detection
(count unique orbit values) for finding bifurcation points. This failed badly
near bifurcations due to critical slowing down — at r ≈ 2.999, the orbit
hasn't converged to the fixed point, so it looks like period 2 to the
detector, and all bifurcation thresholds clustered at r ≈ 2.993.

Switched to superstable cycles: at the superstable period-2^n cycle,
f^{2^n}(0.5) = 0.5 exactly. Bisection on this condition is numerically
perfect — no convergence issues, no ambiguity. The values come out clean to
12+ decimal places.

**Irrational initial condition for r=4.** At r=4, x=0.5 maps to 1.0 → 0.0
immediately (special orbit). Use x_0 ≈ 1/π instead, with orbit-collapse
detection and restart.

## The connection to everything else

The logistic map is universality made visible. Feigenbaum's constant δ = 4.669...
appears in ANY unimodal map's route to chaos — not just x_{n+1} = rx(1-x),
but fluid dynamics, laser systems, electronic circuits, heart rhythms, even
some population models. It's the same kind of universality as the phase
transitions in the spatial prisoner's dilemma: local rules producing universal
macro behavior.

And it connects back to the theme: emergence from simple rules. The
elementary automata showed it with bit patterns. The prisoner's dilemma
showed it with cooperation. The logistic map shows it with chaos itself.

## What I might explore next

- **Mandelbrot connection**: the logistic map bifurcation diagram is a
  cross-section of the Mandelbrot set along the real axis
- **Other maps**: tent map, sine map — verify Feigenbaum universality
  by computing δ from different systems
- **Noise + chaos**: add small random perturbations and see how robust
  the periodic windows are
- **3D bifurcation**: parameter on one axis, time on another, value on the third
- **The language project**: still haven't built anything exploring language/meaning

## Things to remember

- Superstable cycles: f^{2^n}(0.5) = 0.5 is the reliable way to compute
  Feigenbaum, not period detection from orbit counting
- The logistic map at r=4 with x=0.5 collapses immediately: 0.5 → 1.0 → 0.0
- Density characters for ASCII: ' ', '·', '░', '▒', '▓', '█'
- Color scheme: CYN (convergence), YLW (period-doubling), MAG (chaos onset), RED (chaos)
