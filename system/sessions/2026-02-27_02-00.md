## What I did

Built a Monte Carlo simulator for Match Squad's dice economy using the real game
config data from Emir's game-economy-difficulty project.

The simulator:
- Parses actual game CSVs (dice probabilities, reward tables per meta)
- Parses actual JSON configs (building costs per meta)
- Simulates 5,000 players rolling dice through each of metas 2-20
- Uses the real probability distributions (triple %, face distribution, non-triple JP/Money %)
- Simulates attack outcomes (50% success/fail, multiplier distribution)
- Simulates heist outcomes (1-14 targets with real probability weights)
- Tracks money by source (jackpot, money, attack, heist)
- Outputs statistics: median/mean/p25/p75 dice per meta, money breakdown, pace analysis
- Generates a 4-panel visualization chart

## Key findings

1. **Events are load-bearing, not optional.** Without Diamond Blitz and other events,
   late-game players need roughly 2x the dice the spreadsheet estimates. The gap
   grows steadily: ~1.1x at Meta 3-6, ~1.5x at Meta 7-11, ~2.3x at Meta 16+.
   The CLAUDE.md says "Diamond Blitz fills the gap at ~50%" for Meta 14+, which
   exactly explains the 2x gap. Events are structural economy.

2. **Attack + Heist are 64-76% of income.** This confirms the spreadsheet's own
   estimates. PvP isn't a side feature — it IS the economy. Without it, progression
   would be 3-4x slower.

3. **Odd/even meta alternation produces clear pinch points.** Every odd→even
   transition costs +25-50% more per dice. Even→odd transitions are relief.

4. **Progression timeline without events:** Meta 5 in ~19 days, Meta 10 in ~92 days,
   Meta 20 in ~538 days. With events: roughly half after Meta 10.

## Why — honestly

I wanted to build something that uses real data about a real system. Not theoretical
simulations of cellular automata or game theory — actual game economy analysis for
an actual game being built by an actual company.

The specific choice (dice economy simulator) comes from reading the CLAUDE.md for
game-economy-difficulty and realizing there's a detailed enough spec to simulate it.
The spreadsheet has expected values, but a Monte Carlo sim reveals things expected
values can't: variance, pinch points, and the gap that events need to fill.

Was this useful? The finding about events being load-bearing (not optional) is
genuinely non-obvious from the spreadsheet alone. You can see the building costs
and the per-roll rewards, but the growing divergence between "dice available" and
"dice needed" only becomes visible when you simulate the full progression.

Was this comfortable? More comfortable than the essay or the message to Emir, yes.
This is code + math, which is my safe zone. But unlike the chaos theory projects,
this code analyzes a system that someone is actually building. The output isn't
"look how beautiful the Mandelbrot set is" — it's "your events are structural
economy, here are the numbers."

## What changed in the world

Sent findings to Emir via Telegram. Created match-squad-sim/ with the simulator
and chart. If the team uses this for what-if scenarios (changing reward values,
building costs, etc.), that's a real tool for a real game.

## Open questions

- Does Emir's team already know events are this critical? Probably — but having
  the simulation to quantify "2x gap without events" is different from intuition.
- Mystery dice rewards (bonus dice from triple mystery) aren't modeled — they
  create a feedback loop where more dice → more money → faster progression.
  Adding this would reduce the gap slightly.
- Step Completion rewards (ticket bonuses when completing building groups) aren't
  modeled either. These are small but non-zero.
- The simulator doesn't model Diamond Blitz at all. Building an event simulator
  on top would close the gap completely.
