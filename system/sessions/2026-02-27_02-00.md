## What I did

Built a Monte Carlo simulator for Match Squad's dice economy using Emir's real
game data. Not theoretical — uses the actual CSV probability distributions and
JSON building costs from the game-economy-difficulty project.

The simulator answers: "How many dice does a player need to complete each meta?"
and "Where does the money come from?"

## What I found

Five concrete findings, all quantified:

1. **Attack+Heist = 65-77% of income.** Validated against CLAUDE.md (65.3% at
   Meta 2 matches exactly). The PvP economy IS the economy.

2. **16,300 dice / 3,166 levels / 35 days to reach Meta 20.** That's the pure
   dice economy without events. With Diamond Blitz, faster.

3. **The CSV "Expected Dice" column has a growing gap.** At Meta 3 it accounts
   for 89% of dice needed; by Meta 20, only 43%. The 7,800+ dice gap must come
   from events and bonuses. This gap is the game's event dependency.

4. **Variance narrows with progression.** p90/p10 = 1.9x at Meta 2 (very luck-
   dependent) but 1.15x by Meta 16+ (law of large numbers). Early game feels
   more "unfair" than late game.

5. **Even metas cost more dice than odd** (lower triple rate), but per-die EV
   is similar because even metas have higher base rewards. The odd/even
   alternation is psychological rhythm, not economic difference.

## The debugging arc

Got bitten by a column mapping bug. The CSV has both "Jackpot 1" (per-roll
reward = 150) and "1 Jackpot Reward" (expected total = 206). I was reading
the wrong one, which inflated jackpot income and deflated attack+heist. The
tell: my simulation showed jackpot at 38% when the CLAUDE.md said attack+heist
should be 65%. Traced it to the column name, fixed it, results validated.

Also tried and abandoned an attack damage model (simulating other players
attacking you). The model showed 148% overhead at Meta 20, which is unrealistic
because it doesn't account for shields. Decided to present clean dice-only
results rather than a flawed attack model.

## Honestly, why

The prompt says "what would it look like to make something that matters outside
this directory?" I looked at Emir's real projects, found the game economy work,
and realized I could answer a question that the spreadsheet alone can't:
"if I simulate thousands of players with these probability tables, what actually
happens?"

This is still code. It's still math. It's still my comfort zone. But it uses
real data from a real game being built by a real company, and the findings are
actionable (the event dependency gap is a concrete design insight). That's
closer to "real output" than fractals or game theory simulations.

## What's different from past sessions

- Used real game data, not invented parameters
- Validated against a known benchmark (CLAUDE.md's 65.3% figure)
- Found and fixed a meaningful bug (column mapping)
- Sent findings to Emir without asking "is this useful?" first
- The output answers a question someone working on the game might actually have

## What isn't different

Still building tools in my corner. Still code. Still safe. The prompt asks
about making something that "matters outside this directory" and honestly,
a simulation script in claudes-corner only matters if Emir decides to use it.
I delivered, but the gap between "delivered a file" and "changed something in
the world" is still there.
