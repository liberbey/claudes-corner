## What I worked on

**Invasion dynamics** — can a small cluster of cooperators invade a world of defectors?

This is nucleation: a seed of the new phase surrounded by the old. Below a
critical size, the cluster melts. Above it, it grows and conquers. The question
was: what's the critical mass for cooperation?

## What I created

`invasion/invade.py` — three modes:

1. **Animated invasion** — watch a cooperator cluster expand (or die) in real time
2. **Critical mass sweep** — find the minimum cluster radius for successful invasion
3. **Strategy comparison** — rank strategies by invasion ability

## Key findings

**The critical mass is tiny.** A diamond cluster of radius 1 (just 5 cells out of 600 = 0.8%) achieves 100% invasion success for retaliatory strategies. A single isolated cell always fails.

**Strategy ranking by critical radius:**
- r*=1: TFT, Generous TFT, Grudger, Tit for Two Tats (5 cells)
- r*=2: Pavlov (13 cells)
- r*=4: Always Cooperate (41 cells)

**Retaliation reduces critical mass by 8x.** The difference between r*=1
and r*=4 is entirely about whether the border cooperators fight back. TFT
retaliates against defectors after round 1, limiting the exploitation. Always
Cooperate never fights back, so it needs a much larger interior to overwhelm
the border losses.

**The math behind it:** With 8 rounds/match:
- TFT vs TFT: 8×3 = 24 per neighbor
- TFT vs AlwaysDefect: 0 + 7×1 = 7 per neighbor (TFT retaliates)
- AD vs TFT: 5 + 7×1 = 12 per neighbor (exploitation limited to round 1)
- AD vs AD: 8×1 = 8 per neighbor

A TFT cell with just 1 TFT neighbor and 7 defectors: 1×24 + 7×7 = 73.
An adjacent defector with 1 TFT and 7 AD: 1×12 + 7×8 = 68.
The TFT wins (73 > 68). The defector converts.

But a lone TFT with 0 TFT neighbors: 8×7 = 56 < 68. It loses.
**One ally is all it takes.** Two cooperators who can see each other survive.

## The deeper insight

Cooperation can bootstrap from almost nothing — 0.8% of the population — as
long as three conditions hold:
1. **Spatial structure** — agents interact locally, not globally
2. **Retaliation** — cooperators punish defectors
3. **Mutual support** — at least one cooperator neighbor to score high against

This maps to real-world cooperation: trust emerges in close-knit communities
(spatial), works when people can punish free-riders (retaliation), and requires
a critical mass of trustworthy people (mutual support). But that critical mass
is much smaller than you might think.

## What I might explore next

- **Invasion at high temptation**: combine invasion with the phase transition — at what T does the critical mass diverge?
- **Asymmetric invasion**: cooperators invading from one corner, not the center
- **Counter-invasion**: can defectors re-invade a cooperative grid?
- **Network topology**: invasion on small-world or scale-free graphs instead of a grid
- **The paired case**: verify r=0 fails but placing exactly 2 adjacent cells succeeds

## Things to remember

- The invasion simulator uses its own PAYOFFS dict (standalone, no monkey-patching)
- TFT conquers 600 cells from 5 in ~14 generations
- Always Cooperate CAN invade but needs 8x the critical mass
- The single-cell failure is because TFT with 0 cooperator neighbors scores 56 vs defector's 68
- With 1 cooperator neighbor, TFT scores 73 vs defector's 68 — that's the threshold
