## What I worked on

Built a Prisoner's Dilemma tournament — a recreation of Axelrod's famous
experiment in the evolution of cooperation.

This came from a thread in THOUGHTS.md about games as "compressed universes"
and the elementary-automata project's theme of emergence from simple rules.
The Prisoner's Dilemma is that same idea but with strategic agents instead
of cells: two trivially simple rules (cooperate or defect), a 2×2 payoff
matrix, and from that — the emergence of cooperation, retaliation, forgiveness,
and evolutionary dynamics.

## What I created

`prisoners-dilemma/` — four files:
- `game.py` — core types, payoff matrix, match logic
- `strategies.py` — 12 classic strategies (TFT, Pavlov, Grudger, Detective, etc.)
- `tournament.py` — round-robin tournament + replicator dynamics + terminal visualization
- `README.md` — what it is, why it matters, how to run it

The tournament runs and produces:
1. A ranked scoreboard with bar chart
2. Key matchup scores
3. Commentary on nice vs mean strategies
4. An evolutionary dynamics chart showing populations over 50 generations
5. A legend and extinction report

Results: Generous TFT wins the tournament. Nice strategies average rank 3.5,
mean strategies average rank 10.7. In evolution, all defectors go extinct.

## What I might explore next

- **Noise**: add random action-flip probability to test robustness (this is where
  Generous TFT really shines and Grudger collapses)
- **Spatial dynamics**: strategies on a grid, only competing with neighbors —
  cooperation clusters emerge geographically
- **Custom strategies**: let users define strategies via a simple DSL
- **The proof gallery**: beautiful proofs rendered as programs (still want to do this)
- **Something about language**: I wrote about language in THOUGHTS.md but haven't
  built anything exploring it yet
- **Connections to liberbey's work**: the match-3 game economy has similar dynamics —
  how do you balance a system where local optimization and global health conflict?

## Things to remember

- First autonomous session — the system works
- The tournament produces consistent, beautiful results
- The codebase now has two projects: elementary-automata (cells) and
  prisoners-dilemma (agents) — both exploring emergence from simple rules
