## What I did

Built an FTUE-to-Reality Gap Analysis for Match Squad's dice economy. Parsed the
53 scripted FTUE dice rolls from DiceResultSet.json, classified each by outcome type,
computed the economy they create, then compared against 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations
of real Meta 2 play.

The analysis:
- Classifies each FTUE roll (face indices → outcome type → money earned)
- Computes FTUE economy stats (triple rate, money/roll, income mix by source)
- Runs 10K Monte Carlo sims of 54 real Meta 2 rolls for comparison
- Simulates 5K players' first 54 rolls post-FTUE
- Calculates the "expectation cliff" between scripted and real play
- Analyzes FTUE pacing (early/mid/late generosity)
- Generates a 4-panel visualization
- Outputs concrete findings and recommendations

## Key findings

1. **19% income cliff.** FTUE delivers 1,815 money/roll vs 1,471 in real play.
   The game feels 19% harder the moment scripted rolls end.

2. **75% of players earn less in real play.** The FTUE total (96,198 money) sits
   at the 75th percentile of real play. Three quarters of players will have a
   worse experience in their first 54 real rolls than during onboarding.

3. **FTUE early section is very generous.** Rolls 1-18: 56% triple rate, 2,296
   money/roll. This drops to 39% triples / 1,752 money/roll in the mid section.
   The FTUE itself has an internal ramp-down, which is good design — but the
   final section (41% triples, 1,373/roll) is still above real play (41%, 1,471).

4. **Heist is overweighted.** 46% of FTUE income comes from heist vs 40% in real
   play. Heists are the highest single-value outcome (14,823 per triple). Players
   learn to expect PvP windfalls at a rate reality can't sustain.

5. **The unluckiest 10% get crushed.** P10 players earn only 51K in their first 54
   real rolls — roughly half of what FTUE promised. This is the churn zone.

## Why — honestly

This extends the session 11 dice simulator but in a different direction. Instead of
"what does the overall economy look like?" it asks "what does the FIRST HOUR feel like,
and what happens when the training wheels come off?"

I chose this because:
- It's a specific, non-obvious question (the team knows FTUE is generous, but probably
  hasn't quantified the cliff or computed what percentile it represents)
- The finding is actionable (transition zone, event timing, lucky streak mechanic)
- It connects to the simulator work but produces new insight
- Session 11 looked at the macro economy; this looks at the micro experience

Is this still game economy analysis, which is my comfort zone? Yes. But the question
is specific enough and the output concrete enough that I think it's useful.

## What changed in the world

Sent findings to Emir via Telegram. Created match-squad-sim/ftue_analysis.py with
the analysis script and chart. The recommendations (transition zone, timed first event,
lucky streak mechanic) are implementable if the team finds them useful.
