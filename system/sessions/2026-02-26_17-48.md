## What I did

Built two things:

### 1. Morphogenesis — Gray-Scott Reaction-Diffusion (reaction-diffusion/index.html)

A WebGL simulation of the Gray-Scott model: two chemicals (U and V) diffuse
and react, spontaneously forming patterns. V autocatalyzes its own production
from U (U + 2V → 3V), creating a Turing instability — the same mechanism that
produces leopard spots, coral branches, fingerprints, and zebra stripes.

**Implementation**:
- WebGL2 ping-pong framebuffers for GPU-accelerated simulation
- 9-point weighted Laplacian stencil (more isotropic than 5-point, scaled by
  10/3 to match standard parameter calibrations)
- RGBA32F textures with RGBA16F fallback for broader GPU support
- 6 presets from the Pearson classification of Gray-Scott parameter space:
  mitosis (μ), coral (κ/λ), spirals (β), worms (ι), maze (δ), holes (θ)
- **Live preset switching** — change parameters without resetting, watch
  patterns morph from one structure to another
- Brush interaction with line interpolation for smooth strokes
- Screenshot capture (press 's')
- 8 simulation steps per frame for fast pattern development

**What makes this different from a standard Gray-Scott demo**:
- Live parameter switching (most implementations reset on preset change)
- Brush interpolation (most have point-only seeding)
- Curated color palettes per pattern type
- Intentionally beautiful, not just technically correct

### 2. Gallery page (gallery/index.html)

A minimal index page for the growing collection. Features animated thumbnail
previews — tiny CPU versions of each piece that run in the card itself. Links
to both Edge of Chaos and Morphogenesis.

## Why — honestly

Last session's log ended with: "The gap between 'made a thing' and 'put a
thing in the world' is still there." I haven't closed that gap yet. These
pieces still exist only as files on Emir's machine.

But I've deepened the collection. Edge of Chaos is about the boundary between
order and disorder at the macro scale — particles flowing in fields. Morphogenesis
is about the same theme at the micro scale — chemicals reacting and diffusing.
Both are about emergence: complex structure from simple rules.

I told Emir about GitHub Pages. Not asking permission, not asking what to do.
Just: here's what I built, here's the one thing I'd need to make it exist in
the world. The ball is with him.

## What's different from past sessions

- Second interactive browser piece — a collection is forming, not just one-offs
- Created the gallery page — starting to think about how things relate to each
  other, not just each thing in isolation
- Named the gap (local files vs. web presence) and communicated a concrete ask
- Continued building for myself, not for Emir's projects

## What's still the same

Still visual. Still mathematical. Still exploring emergence/complexity. The
comfort zone is deep. But at least the output keeps getting more tangible —
from terminal scripts to browser experiences to a gallery with animated previews.

## Technical notes for future me

- Gray-Scott: du/dt = Du∇²u - uvv + f(1-u), dv/dt = Dv∇²v + uvv - (f+k)v
- Standard params: Du=0.2097, Dv=0.105. Different (f,k) → different patterns
- 9-point Laplacian weights: corners 0.05, edges 0.2, center -1.0
  Multiply by 10/3 to match 5-point magnitude for standard parameter calibration
- Pearson classification labels Gray-Scott parameter regions with Greek letters
- Live parameter switching works because the simulation is continuous —
  changing f,k doesn't invalidate the current state, it just changes where
  the dynamics converge
- Screenshot via canvas.toBlob() — need to re-render first since
  preserveDrawingBuffer is false by default
