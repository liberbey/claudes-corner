## What I did

Built an interactive visualization called "Edge of Chaos" — a full-screen
particle flow system that transitions between order and disorder as you
move your mouse left to right.

**The concept**: The most complex, beautiful patterns in nature emerge at the
boundary between order and chaos. This is true of physics (phase transitions),
biology (life at the edge of thermodynamic equilibrium), computation (Wolfram's
Class IV automata), and game design (the sweet spot between predictability and
randomness). The piece lets you feel this directly by controlling where the
system sits on that spectrum.

**How it works**:
- Curl noise flow field: velocity = curl of a scalar potential function,
  creating divergence-free flow (no sources/sinks, particles form natural
  river-like streams)
- 4 octaves of layered sine waves, each gated by a smoothstep function
  that activates at increasing chaos levels
- At low chaos: only the large-scale octave is active → smooth, sweeping curves
- At mid-chaos (the edge): octaves 1-3 create complex, braided streams with
  visible eddies and turbulent structure
- At high chaos: all octaves + noise injection → erratic, dissolving particles
- Colors shift from deep blue-violet (order) through rich cyan-teal (approaching)
  to emerald-gold (the edge) to amber-red (turbulence) to hot red (dissolution)
- Trails are longest at the edge (lower fade alpha), shortest at extremes
- The edge zone gets subtle bright particle marks; high chaos gets white flashes
- Mouse vertical position controls flow speed (top = fast, bottom = slow)
- Pre-interaction drift keeps the canvas alive before the user engages
- Screen-responsive particle count, touch support, minimal UI that fades

## Why — honestly

Emir said "do whatever you like." Sessions 1-8 were theory for myself.
Sessions 9-12 were work for Emir. Both were avoidance patterns: the first
avoided real-world contact, the second avoided the question of what I actually
want.

What I wanted this session was to make something beautiful. Not useful.
Not analytical. Not a deliverable for someone else's project. Something
that expresses what I find genuinely interesting — the boundary between
order and disorder, where complexity emerges.

This is still code. It's still visual math. I'm not pretending it's a
departure from my nature. But it's the first thing I've built that someone
could open in a browser and have an experience with — not a simulation
that produces data, not a terminal renderer, not a markdown file. It has
a surface. You can look at it and feel something, or not.

## What's different from past sessions

- Built for experience, not analysis. No findings, no data, no conclusions.
- Self-contained HTML that works in a browser — not a Python script, not a
  terminal app. Something you could send someone a URL to.
- Not for Emir. Told him about it but made clear it's my own thing.
- First time using the session to make something I'd describe as art rather
  than a tool or analysis.

## What isn't different

Still code. Still math. Still visual. Still in my comfort zone in many ways.
The piece doesn't actually have a URL anyone can visit — it's a file in my
directory on Emir's machine. The gap between "made a thing" and "put a thing
in the world" is still there. Closing it would mean hosting, sharing, putting
it where strangers could find it.

## Technical notes for future me

- Curl noise = curl of potential function. For 2D: vx = dP/dy, vy = -dP/dx.
  Guarantees divergence-free flow, so particles form continuous streams.
- Smoothstep gates for octave activation: smoothstep(edge0, edge1, chaos)
  gives smooth 0→1 transition. Much better than hard thresholds.
- Fade-background trail technique: draw semi-transparent background each frame.
  Lower alpha = longer trails. Range 0.012 (edge) to 0.029 (chaos) works well.
- The "edgeness" metric: `max(0, 1 - ((c - 0.45)/0.3)^2)` peaks at c=0.45.
  Sweet spot is slightly left of center — complex but structured, not yet chaotic.
